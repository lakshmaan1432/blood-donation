        <h2>What is Blood Donation?</h2>

        <p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into
            biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation. Donation may be of whole blood, or of
            specific components directly.</p>

        <p>Blood is essential to help patients survive surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic
            injuries. This lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for blood is
            constant. But only about 3% of age-eligible people donate blood yearly.

        <h2>Blood Donation Tips:</h2>
        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4dgWDYW4AE-O9l.jpg" alt="">
        <ul>
            <li> Drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated makes it easier to find your veins and prevents you from
                becoming light-headed after donating, Dr. Vossoughi says. </li>
            <li>Eat well beforehand. Don’t skip breakfast, and be sure to eat snacks offered to you. “These things will
                help you tolerate the donation well and feel like yourself the rest of the day,” she says.</li>
            <li>Exercise before donating blood, not afterward. It’s OK to go to the gym before you donate blood but not
                so wise afterward. “We don’t want people getting dizzy,” Dr. Vossoughi says. “You’ve basically done your
                workout for the day once you’ve donated blood.”</li>
            <li>Take iron tablets. The American Red Cross recommends that individuals who donate blood frequently take
                an iron supplement or a multivitamin with iron. “More and more, we’re recommending that teenage donors
                in particular take iron, because it’s been shown that teenage donors may become iron deficient after
                blood donation,” Dr. DeSimone says.</li>

        <h2>How does the Blood Donation Process Work?</h2>
        <img src="https://www.dakminnbloodbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Donation-Process-1.png" alt="">
        <ul>
            <li> Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The
                donation
                process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. The donation itself is
                only
                about 8-10 minutes on average. The steps in the process are:</li>
            <li> Registration

                You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone
                number,
                and donor identification number (if you have one).
                You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.
            <li> Health History and Mini Physical


                You will answer some questions during a private and confidential interview about your health history and
                the
                places you have traveled.
                You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.</li>
            <li>
                Donation

                We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This
                feels
                like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
                You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10
                minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2
                hours.)
                When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will
                place a bandage on your arm.</li>
            <li>Refreshments

                You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight
                decrease
                in fluid volume.
                After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
                Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.
                Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a
                shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.</li>
